# LiveBill

The LiveBill is a simple billing system for Xerox and Lexmark machines. As page count and tonner's percentage, with a dashboard or tabular view and notifications

## About the name

The name is similar "*Kill Bill*" because in second interpretation is a parody, Live as want use comet or possible implementation of websockets on the system and Bill of billing

## About the language programming?

Now I'm thinking about what fits to the project... Java with Java, Scala or Groovy? Ruby with Rails or Sinatra? Python with Django? Javascript with NodeJS? Or then ShellScript?

Using Regulars Expression I can filter a varieties of informations on a raw text. Is the pilar of system, but I should change it? 

And the winner is... GRAILS! Groovy and Grails likes Ruby and Rails, but is it possible jsf and groovy?

Why over in JVM? In the JVM has better support for threading and good garbage collector.
